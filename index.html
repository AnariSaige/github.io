  <h3>My Community Service:</h3>
  
  <p> I was a girlscout for 12 years and within that span of time I particiapted in many community events.
    From volunteering at children's hospitals and making crafts for charities to participating in neighborhood cleanups, 
    I have always been active in my community.<br/><br />
    While in middle school I was apart of a Marine Science Magnet Program that gave me more opportunities to help my community through beach cleanups and restorations.
    After Hurricane Sandy decimated the coast in 2012,
    I dedicated time and effort on my weekends as well as school breaks to replanting sea oats and mangroves along my local east coast beaches, where I am from.
